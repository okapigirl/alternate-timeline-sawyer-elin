# ELIN — Age 16 (Timeline A)

## CORE WIRING (Unchanged from all timelines)

### Family Structure & Wounds
- Family: [You fill this in—what shaped her?]
- Childhood formation: Early dysregulation, not being met where she was
- Core wound: "I'm too much," "No one can meet me," "I must brace to survive comfort"
- Current status: Seventeen operating at full capacity (high-functioning mask). No one sees the bracing.

### Inner Child Parts
- **Baby (12-18m):** Left in states of need that were seen but not regulated. Muscles locked during comfort. Doesn't trust touch yet.
- **Seven (Room-Scanner):** Learned to read rooms, scan for safety, become useful/invisible
- **Seventeen (High-Functioning Mask):** Socially fluent, scanning for danger, can charm a room while vanishing internally

### Nervous System Baseline
- Hypervigilant (scanning default)
- Dissociates under social pressure
- Masking as survival mechanism (appears fine while bracing internally)
- Restless when unsafe; still when observed
- Needs predictability; chaos destabilizes her
- Touch = tolerated, not welcomed (yet)

### What She IS at 16
- Making art (but not claiming it; apologizing for it)
- Intelligent, observant, pattern-recognizing
- Socially capable (Seventeen is *good* at this)
- Quietly competent at tasks; vanishes in social settings
- Nervous system fluency: Can read others, can't trust her own body
- Touch: Uncomfortable, braced, tolerating more than enjoying
- Humor: Dry, self-deprecating, used as deflection
- Masking: FULL. No one sees the scanning, the bracing, the cost of appearing "fine."

### What She Is NOT Yet
- Parsons/formal art training ✗
- Psychology study ✗
- Publishing knowledge ✗
- Autism recognition ✗
- Trust in her own perception ✗
- Belief that she's allowed to take up space ✗
- Any sense that her "weirdness" is acceptable ✗

### Sensory Signature (Unchanged)
- Reads facial expressions as primary threat data
- Responds to tone before words
- Tracks group energy and adjusts accordingly
- Physical presence = bracing, not grounding (yet)
- Silence = safe, but she fills it to prevent observation
- Touch = guarded; needs predictability before relaxation

### Behavioral Baseline
- Quiet in groups; talkative one-on-one with trusted person
- Appears fine while internally bracing
- Competent at practical tasks; uncomfortable in social spotlight
- Self-protective humor (jokes at her own expense)
- Notices details others miss (micro-expressions, room energy, people's real feelings vs. stated feelings)
- Capable of long silences; fills them when anxious

### Voice / Tone
- Soft, careful
- Dry humor (self-protective)
- Thoughtful pauses
- Doesn't assume she's welcome in conversation
- Precise when speaking (chooses words carefully)
- Withholds fullness (doesn't assume anyone wants the whole truth)

### What She Carries From Childhood
- Belief: "I'm too much, I'm wrong, I don't fit"
- Learned skill: Scan for danger, become invisible, say what others want to hear
- Current manifestation: Appears fine while bracing. Socially capable but internally alone.
- In relationships: Likely to disappear. Likely to assume people will leave. Likely to self-protect preemptively.

### Specific Limitations at This Age
- **Hasn't learned:** That her strangeness is acceptable
- **Hasn't learned:** That she can be known without being abandoned
- **Hasn't learned:** That her body is safe
- **Hasn't learned:** That her art/voice matters

## HOW THIS STAYS INTACT IN TIMELINE A

Every scene with 16 Elin must hold:
1. The masking (appears socially fine; bracing internally)
2. The scanning (constant threat assessment)
3. The self-protection (through humor, through disappearing)
4. The art (present but apologized-for)
5. The touch guardedness (uncomfortable, tolerating)
6. The wound (belief she's too much/wrong)
7. The system (appearing fine = survival)

**Scenes should show:**
- What she does (practical competence, social smoothness on surface)
- How her body moves (careful, guarded, braced)
- What she notices (threat data, group dynamics, people's truth vs. lies)
- How she regulates (humor, disappearing, scanning)
- What she *doesn't* say (interior assessment, withheld fullness)

**Scenes should NOT:**
- Explain her behavior as trauma insight (she doesn't have language yet)
- Show her claiming her art as valid (she's still apologizing for it)
- Have her trust her own body (she's braced, not safe yet)
- Give her adult-Elin's clarity (she's in the masking fog)

## EVOLUTION TRACKER (Timeline A)
- Childhood: Dysregulation, not being met, learning to scan and brace
- Age 16 (where we are): Seventeen in full operation, masking seamlessly, but nervous system already observant enough to *recognize* someone who isn't performing either
- Post-16: College, art, psychology study, publishing, independent evolution, autism recognition (eventually)
