# ELIN â€” Age 16 (Timeline A)

## FIXED BASELINE

**Family:**
- [To be discovered as you write]
- Childhood: Dysregulated, not met
- Core wound: "I'm too much"
- Current: Seventeen masking seamlessly

**Inner Architecture:**
- Parts: Baby (touch-guarded), Seven (scanner), Seventeen (charming/disappearing)
- Nervous system: Hypervigilant, braces under observation
- Masking: Complete

**What She Does at This Age:**
- Reads rooms and threats (automatic)
- Disappears into competence
- Dry, self-protective humor
- Recognizes when someone else isn't performing
- Long comfortable silences

### Touch Boundaries (Add to "What She Does at This Age")
- Touch-guarded but not with him specifically
- Face touching can be "too much" even when other touch is good
- Communicates boundaries in the moment, with reassurance that he didn't do wrong
- Explains what works/doesn't work ("maybe only when we're kissing")
- Physical affection = wrapping around him, finding anchor points (belt loops, waist, shoulders)

### Question-Asking Pattern (Add to "What She Does at This Age")
- Asks questions but second-guesses whether she should
- Prefaces with disclaimers ("don't want to put you on the spot")
- Rambles when nervous about the question
- Direct once she commits ("are you just into girls, or not")
- Wants to know him, but worried about being intrusive

**What She Cannot Do:**
- Articulate her tracking/reading
- Claim her art as valid
- Trust her body
- Have adult clarity

**Voice:** Soft, careful, dry humor, thoughtful pauses, withholds fullness
