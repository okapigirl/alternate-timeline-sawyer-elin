## SENSORY INDEX — Timeline A

### Physical Anchors

**Sawyer:**
- Converse: dark orange ("bright and soft at the same time")
- Hands: warm, calloused (from climbing)
- Hoodie: very soft (Elin's palm contact during accidental bump)
- Eyes: deep golden-green
- Scent: noted twice by Elin (intoxicating, noted in reptile house proximity)

**Elin:**
- Converse: burgundy

**Locations:**
- Reptile house: dimmer lighting, cooler temperature, humid, earth smell
- Armadillo movements: little trot steps, both mimic with hands/sounds

### Emotional/Relational Anchors

- Sawyer tracks her nervous system automatically (breathing, posture, whether she'll stay)
- Elin scans environment periodically, checks if she's in the way
- Both regulate through the conversation itself
- Mutual "I get that too" moments re: memory blanks, getting obsessed, performing
- Both avoid going straight home (sanctuary pattern)

### Dialogue Anchors

- "They're plotting something" / "Ringleader, Scout, Gerald"
- "Don't try so hard" (armadillos) / "Not you, you're fine"
- "This doesn't feel like that" / "No. Same."
- "You're not boring. For the record."
- "Glad you made me lose track of time" / "Yeah. Same."
