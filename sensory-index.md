## SENSORY INDEX — Timeline A

### Physical Anchors

**Sawyer:**
- Converse: dark orange ("bright and soft at the same time")
- Hands: warm, calloused (from climbing)
- Hoodie: very soft (Elin's palm contact during accidental bump in Scene 1)
- Eyes: deep golden-green
- Scent: noted twice by Elin (intoxicating, noted in reptile house proximity in Scene 1)
- Phone buzz: immediate grab response; dopamine trigger associated with Elin (Scene 2)
- Chest: physical sensation of "humming," heart-pounding during texting (Scene 2)
- Body state: "Entire body still humming" — physiological arousal/presence post-texting (Scene 2)

**Elin:**
- Converse: burgundy
- Phone: primary sensory anchor; texting as safe distance for vulnerability (Scene 2)
- Sarcasm: safety valve ("Yay /s" in response to early pickup disappointment, Scene 2)

**Locations:**
- Reptile house: dimmer lighting, cooler temperature, humid, earth smell (Scene 1)
- Armadillo movements: little trot steps, both mimic with hands/sounds (Scene 1)
- Sawyer's room: safe space for processing; retreat from family performance (Scene 2)
- Car (Elin's): confined space; texting as escape during early pickup (Scene 2)
- Family dinner table: contrast location; Sawyer performing steadiness while internal state is activated (Scene 2)
- Nightstand: texting location; ceiling-staring position during processing (Scene 2)

### Emotional/Relational Anchors

**Scene 1 Anchors:**
- Sawyer tracks her nervous system automatically (breathing, posture, whether she'll stay)
- Elin scans environment periodically, checks if she's in the way
- Both regulate through the conversation itself
- Mutual "I get that too" moments re: memory blanks, getting obsessed, performing
- Both avoid going straight home (sanctuary pattern)

**Scene 2 Anchors (New):**
- Texting as vulnerability permission: both drop masking layers when spatially separated
- Heart-pounding recognition: physical response to each other's words/presence
- "Already know you" moment: deep recognition despite hours-long acquaintance
- Anticipation as bodily sensation: "wanting," "humming," "pounding" — emotional states register as physical
- Turned-on acknowledgment: first explicit mutual recognition of sexual/physical attraction
- Filters off agreement: both commit to authenticity in texting; safe container for truth-telling
- Dissociation/settling pattern: physical movement (walking home) transitions to still processing (ceiling-staring)
- Protective instinct toward Elin: early pickup disappointment met with validation/care in Sawyer's responses
- Self-erasure tendency emerging: Sawyer likely downplaying his own state to focus on hers (pattern to monitor)
- Elin's vulnerability in texting: more "filters off" than she likely displays in person
- Touch-guarded baseline maintained: no direct discussion of physical touch, but anticipation is present
- Recognition of being "seen": Elin responds to Sawyer's non-performing authenticity with her own

### Dialogue Anchors

**Scene 1:**
- "They're plotting something" / "Ringleader, Scout, Gerald"
- "Don't try so hard" (armadillos) / "Not you, you're fine"
- "This doesn't feel like that" / "No. Same."
- "You're not boring. For the record."
- "Glad you made me lose track of time" / "Yeah. Same."
- "Glad you were at the armadillos today" — Sawyer's parting words

**Scene 2 (New):**
- "Hi :)" — Elin's opening; soft, direct, present
- "Apparently my dad was at the store so he came from there, halving the time. Yay /s" — Elin's sarcasm + disappointment
- "Already know you even though I just met you" — Elin: deep recognition, vulnerability
- "In the best way" — Elin: frame for the accelerated closeness
- "Weeks. In the best way. Like I already know you even though I just met you" — Full Elin quote; emotional core
- "Good night, Elin. Sleep well. I'll see you tomorrow" — Sawyer: steady, caring, future-focused
- "<3" — Hearts exchanged; first explicit affection symbol
- "*Tomorrow.*" — Sawyer's interior flash; anticipation anchor
- "Heart still pounding, entire body still humming" — Sawyer's physical state post-texting

### Temporal Anchors

**Scene 1:**
- 3:15pm–5:00pm: Zoo visit duration

**Scene 2:**
- 5:15pm–5:30pm: Sawyer's walk home
- ~6:00pm: Family dinner
- 5:30pm–10:35pm: Extended texting exchange
