Sawyer ends evening in heightened state, anticipating tomorrow. | Initial nervous excitement → maintained steadiness through family dinner → private escalation through texting → full emotional/physical acknowledgment → vulnerable connection → anticipatory longing. "Weeks. In the best way. Like I already know you." Sawyer's full commitment to the connection; Elin's trust in the "filters off" agreement. | Sawyer (17-18), Elin (16) |
