## CANONICAL REFERENCES — Timeline A

| Date/Time | Location | Key Events | Emotional Beats | Participants |
|-----------|----------|------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Tuesday, October 2007 (exact date TBD), ~3:15pm–5:00pm | Zoo — Armadillo exhibit, then reptile house | First meeting at armadillo exhibit; Sawyer initiates with coup joke. Mutual recognition of being regulars; both visit for sanctuary. Exchange about masking, performing, school dynamics. Python exhibit — Sawyer shows his "element," discusses efficiency/not performing. Both confirm single status. Physical contact escalates: arm brush, knee contact, shoulder touch, brief hand-holding. Phone numbers exchanged (Sawyer Hollis / Elin Sage). Plans made: Tomorrow 3pm + Saturday (longer). Elin's mom picks her up; Sawyer walks her to entrance. | Initial nervous attraction → gradual relaxation → mutual recognition → explicit interest confirmation. "This doesn't feel like that" — both acknowledge the conversation feels different/real. "Glad you were at the armadillos today" — parting words. | Sawyer (17-18), Elin (16) |
| Tuesday, October 2007 (same day as Scene 1), ~5:15pm–10:35pm | Sawyer's home (kitchen, room); Elin in car, then home/room | Sawyer walks home from zoo, performs normalcy at family dinner (6pm), retreats to room. Extended texting exchange initiated by Elin from car (~5:30pm). Exchange covers: attraction confirmation ("already know you"), mutual agreement to have "filters off," crush/obsession acknowledgment, physical attraction discussion (turning on, want), first kiss anticipation, nervous system states shared, family dynamics (Elin's early pickup, Sawyer's dinner performance), goodnight exchange with hearts. Sawyer ends evening in heightened state, anticipating tomorrow. | Initial nervous excitement → maintained steadiness through family dinner → private escalation through texting → full emotional/physical acknowledgment → vulnerable connection → anticipatory longing. "Weeks. In the best way. Like I already know you." Sawyer's full commitment to the connection; Elin's trust in the "filters off" agreement. | Sawyer (17-18), Elin (16) |
| Wednesday, October 2007 (exact date TBD), ~3:00pm | Maple & Fifth (midpoint bench, near closed coffee shop, tree shade) | School day texting (off-screen). Sawyer arrives early, waits. Midpoint meeting location established. Physical escalation: hand-holding, proximity building, first kiss. Aftermath: staying present, not rushing away. | Sawyer: anticipatory, protective instinct active, hyperaware of her nervous system, wanting to make this good for her. Elin: nervous-excited, touch-guarded but wanting, scanning for safety while trusting him, first kiss anxiety layered with want. Transition from anticipation to reality; both grounded in presence; kiss confirms connection is real. | Sawyer (17-18), Elin (16) |
| Thursday, October 2007 (exact date TBD), afternoon/evening | Elin's house (living room, her room) | Elin's parents home. First home visit for Sawyer. Introductions. Physical escalation: grinding, kissing, increased intimacy within PG-13 bounds. "Girlfriend" explicitly established. Parent dynamics navigated. | Sawyer: protective, attuned to her comfort, managing arousal, presence-focused. Elin: present, initiating physical escalation, trust in safety, internal experience of wanting + permission. Relationship moves from dating to committed/official. | Sawyer (17-18), Elin (16) |
| Friday, October 2007 (exact date TBD), evening | Sawyer's house (living room, dinner, his room) | Sawyer's parents (Caroline & Tom) meet Elin. Family dinner performance. Elin integrated into family space. Private time in room post-dinner. Both navigating parental observation while maintaining connection. | Sawyer: performing steadiness for parents while internally attuned to Elin, protective of her comfort in family space. Elin: reading family dynamics, maintaining composure, present with Sawyer despite audience. Relationship deepens through family integration; overnight plans explicitly referenced. | Sawyer (17-18), Elin (16) |
| Saturday, October 2007 (exact date TBD), 9:52am–5:15pm | Zoo — Armadillo exhibit ("our spot"), café, penguin exhibit, big cats, reptile house, full circuit | Sawyer arrives 8 minutes early (9:52am), heart-racing and hyperaware. Elin arrives on time. First full unrestricted day together—no school rush, no time constraints, no parental logistics pressure. Café transition (hot chocolate, "Hi" moment, forehead-to-forehead). Continuous physical contact: hands intertwined on knee throughout. Python glass kissing (semi-private, "I love you" whispered). Conversation flows naturally: school, observations, random thoughts. Full zoo circuit together. Ritual closing at armadillos (~5pm)—Sawyer behind Elin, arms wrapped, chin over shoulder. Mom pickup text 5:15pm. Extended goodbye kiss. "I love you" exchange at exit. | Sawyer: anticipatory → relaxed → giddy/wrecked (café moment), heart-pounding at start, disbelief/wonder throughout ("I keep saying that because I still can't believe it's real"), counting down to overnight plans ("twenty-one hours"), protective presence (positioning, attunement). Elin: present, relaxed, matching his pace, matching his emotional escalation. Both: continuous "I love you" confirmations, extended physical comfort, grounding in presence rather than performance. Café becomes intimate pause; armadillo closing becomes signature ritual. Overnight plans shift from abstract to concrete countdown. | Sawyer (17-18), Elin (16) |
