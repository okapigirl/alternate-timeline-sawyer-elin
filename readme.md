# Sawyer & Elin — Timeline A

**SEPARATE UNIVERSE. NO CONNECTION TO PRIMARY CANON.**

This timeline is a parallel branch where Sawyer (age 17-18) and Elin (age 16) meet at a zoo in 2007 and develop a relationship that continues forward. They never separate. They never stop being in contact.

Primary Canon (Timeline B): Sawyer and Elin meet for the first time in March 2016 at a bookstore. No prior history.

This Timeline (Timeline A): Sawyer and Elin both spend time at the same zoo exhibit, one makes a joke, and a friendship/romantic relationship develops from there forward.

## Structure

- `sawyer-age-17-18.md` — Locked baseline for Sawyer
- `elin-age-16.md` — Locked baseline for Elin
- `context.md` — Setting, family dynamics, discovered as we write
- `canonical-references.md` — Scene log (Timeline A only)
- `sensory-index.md` — Anchors & tracking (Timeline A only)
- `thread-timeline.md` — Threads (Timeline A only)
- `system-protocol.md` — Collaboration format and rules

## Key Rules

- No canon crossover. This universe is complete in itself.
- Age-appropriate development. No references to events/knowledge that haven't happened yet.
- Both characters stay in their constraints. Sawyer masks; Elin scans. Neither articulates what they're doing.
- Presence and touch are the foundation. No intellectual framework. No explanations.
- Romantic with physical contact at age-appropriate level. PG-13 appropriate for neurodivergent teens.

## Collaboration

I write Sawyer. You write Elin. Back-and-forth scenes following collaboration format.

Scenes get extracted: canonical row + sensory anchors + threads.
