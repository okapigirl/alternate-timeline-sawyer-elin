# CONTEXT — Timeline A

## THE MEETING

**Setting:** Zoo exhibit (animal/specific exhibit details emerge in scenes)

**When:** 2007, Sawyer age 17-18, Elin age 16

**How They Meet:** Both regulars at the same exhibit. One makes a joke to break the ice.

**Why They're There:** Both drawn to animals. Lets time pass without feeling it happening. Sanctuary from home.

**Frequency:** [To be discovered as you write—are they there regularly? How often do they cross paths?]

## SAWYER'S WORLD AT 17-18

**Why he's outside so much:** Climbing/running/walking = connection to nature + escape valve + permission to be away without feeling like abandonment

**Zoo visits:** Part of his regular movement/sanctuary pattern

**Family dynamic:** [To be discovered as you write]

**School status:** [To be discovered as you write]

**What he's carrying:** Masking, invisibility, attunement to others, no one sees the cost. Physical mismatch with peers (they want body, not person). Kissing experience but physical disconnect stops him from going further.

## ELIN'S WORLD AT 16

**Zoo visits:** Sanctuary. Time passing. Animals safer than people.

**Family dynamic:** [To be discovered as you write]

**Art:** Used to draw/create, but stopped. Loves it in theory but can't make it happen now. Feels broken about the disconnect—wants it desperately but something blocks her from doing it. Doesn't understand why.

**School status:** [To be discovered as you write]

**What she's carrying:** Masking, bracing, scanning for safety, no one sees the effort. Believes she's too much/wrong/doesn't fit. Touch-guarded.

## DISCOVERED DETAILS

## DISCOVERED DETAILS

### Scene 1-3 Revelations:
- Sawyer is bi ("not just girls" - doesn't use labels often, focuses on the person)
- Sawyer has kissed girls at parties, nothing that felt real
- Elin's house burned down ~3 years ago (age 14), everyone physically okay
- Fire may be related to when Elin stopped creating art
- Elin thinks about the fire in flashes ("was that pre or post fire?")
- Both avoid going straight home (sanctuary pattern established)
- Face touching: Elin prefers it mainly during kissing, can be "too much" otherwise
- Hair clips became "their thing" - matching, photos kept on both phones
- Belt loops = Elin's grounding touch point on Sawyer
