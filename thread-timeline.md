## RELATIONSHIP SHIFT MARKERS (Scene 6)

1. **From anticipatory to actual:** This is their first full day of "just us" without time constraints—the relationship moves from stolen moments to extended presence

2. **From texting vulnerability to in-person ease:** They move through an entire day together with comfort; conversation flows naturally (no longer dependent on digital buffer for authenticity)

3. **From kissing milestones to casual physical intimacy:** Hand-holding becomes continuous; kissing becomes integrated into day (python glass), not singular event; physical contact is assumed, not negotiated

4. **From "I love you" as milestone to "I love you" as grounding phrase:** Said multiple times throughout day; becomes emotional anchor rather than singular disclosure; functions as regulation tool and reassurance

5. **From "I love you" as milestone to "I love you" as grounding phrase:** Said multiple times throughout day; becomes emotional anchor rather than singular disclosure; functions as regulation tool and reassurance

6. **From anticipating overnight to actively counting down:** First sleepover becomes concrete, numbered reality ("twenty-one hours"); temporal anticipation shifts from abstract to measured countdown

7. **From zoo as meeting place to zoo as ritual/home base:** Armadillo closing becomes signature ritual; they establish behavioral patterns (arrival early, full circuit, closing ritual) that will repeat; zoo transforms from "where they meet" to "where they belong together"

8. **From parental time-pressure to chosen time together:** Without school schedules or parental logistics dictating rhythm, relationship operates on its own rhythm; both relaxed because time isn't being managed externally

9. **From physical escalation as planned milestones to physical affection as natural rhythm:** Kissing, hand-holding, wrapping around him are not "stages" but integrated into ordinary flow of being together

10. **From wondering if this is real to certainty grounded in presence:** Sawyer's "I keep saying that because I still can't believe it's real" reflects disbelief that turns into acceptance throughout day; full day together makes the connection undeniable
