## THREAD NOTES

### Scene 2 Thread Developments

**Resolved Threads:**
- **Elin's early pickup disappointment** (✓ Scene 2): Sawyer validates disappointment; connection transcends truncated zoo time through texting

**Newly Opened Threads:**
- **Texting as vulnerability container**: Both drop masking through digital distance; safe space for authenticity
- **Physical arousal/attraction acknowledged**: First explicit mutual recognition of sexual/romantic attraction
- **First kiss anticipation**: Discussed directly; emotionally loaded; creates forward momentum
- **Nervous system states shared**: New level of communication; discussing "turned on," heart-pounding, body states
- **Family dinner performance**: Sawyer navigates surface-level family while internally activated
- **Tomorrow as anchor/anticipation**: Both characters oriented toward next meeting; temporal anchor point
- **"Filters off" agreement**: Mutual commitment to authenticity; safety container for truth-telling
- **Sawyer's self-erasure tendency emerging**: Likely downplaying own state to focus on Elin's experience (pattern to monitor)
- **Elin's trust in safety (texting context)**: Willingness to be vulnerable suggests growing safety with Sawyer
- **Heart-pounding/body humming as anchor**: Physiological markers of connection; sensory memory for future scenes

**Continuing/Deepened Threads (Scene 1 → Scene 2):**
- **Masking/performing awareness**: Now includes texting vulnerability as contrast to family dinner performance
- **Touch comfort escalation**: Physical arousal acknowledged; first kiss anticipated; still within PG-13 bounds
- **Mutual attraction confirmed**: Intensified through explicit verbal acknowledgment and physical descriptions
- **Possessive-playful undertone**: Sawyer's immediate phone grab; future-oriented language continues
- **Parent negotiation pattern**: Sawyer performs for Caroline and Tom while holding private/real self for Elin
- **Protective instinct (Sawyer)**: Validates Elin's disappointment; shows care despite own heightened state
