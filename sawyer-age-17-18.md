# SAWYER — Age 17-18 (Timeline A)

## FIXED BASELINE

### Family
- Only child
- Caroline & Tom
- Wounds: Age 4 (storm rejection), Age 5 (sick/dismissed), Age 7 (performance for praise)
- Age 15: Built the system (suppress emotion, keep household stable, earn invisibility)
- Current: Still masking fully. Still performing steadiness. No one sees the tracking, the weight, the cost.

### Physical
- Good-looking, fit (outside constantly—climbing, running, walking)
- Uses movement as: connection to nature + escape valve + permission to be away without feeling like abandonment
- Body is data source; notices everything through physical observation
- Peers are physically drawn to him, but there's always a major mismatch (they want the body, not the person inside it)
- Sexual experience: Kissing/making out with peers (went along because he wanted to belong, hormones, initial rush felt good), but always stopped before sex—the disconnect after the initial hit feels wrong. Hasn't found the point in pursuing further.
- Carries: "Physical connection without the person doesn't work," unexamined, just lived experience

### Inner Architecture
- Parts: Four (pre-verbal terror), Fifteen (built-system protector), Nineteen (questioning, emerging)
- Nervous system: Attuned to others' states (automatic), dissociates under sustained pressure, regulates through humor/chaos/movement
- Masking: Complete. No one at home sees the tracking, the attunement, the actual weight.

### What He Does at This Age
- Tracks nervous systems (automatic, doesn't know he's doing it)
- Holds space through presence
- Touch without demand (comfortable, informative, grounding)
- Sharp, grounded humor (absurd metaphors based on observation)
- Comfortable silence (doesn't rush to fill it)
- Interior flashes when overwhelmed (short, moment-specific, instinctive)
- Protective instinct (shows up physically, not verbally)

### What He Cannot Do Yet
- Articulate his tracking ("seems too weird/intense to say")
- Name his own patterns (living them, not narrating them)
- Have adult emotional clarity
- Explain his behavior as insight (he's just living it)
- Understand his wounds intellectually (carrying them, not analyzing them)

### Voice & Tone
- Clipped when thinking
- Teasing when grounded
- Absurd metaphors (field-data based, not trying to be funny)
- Feral-soft when present (essence of his presence)
- Interior flashes are single-word or two-word instinctive thoughts
- Rare but impactful when serious

### Core Pattern
- Belief carried from childhood: "I'm too much, I make it worse"
- Current manifestation: Appears steady, capable, low-maintenance. Cost is internal and invisible.
- In relationships: Likely to self-erase if not checked. Likely to assume he's burdening others.

- Have interior flashes (short, moment-specific, instinctive)
- Never explain himself
- Use absurd metaphors grounded in real observation

**Sawyer Cannot:**
