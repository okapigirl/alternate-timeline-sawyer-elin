# SAWYER — Age 17-18 (Timeline A)

## FIXED BASELINE

### Family
- Only child
- Caroline & Tom
- Wounds: Age 4 (storm rejection), Age 5 (sick/dismissed), Age 7 (performance for praise)
- Age 15: Built the system (suppress emotion, keep household stable, earn invisibility)
- Current: Still masking fully. Still performing steadiness. No one sees the tracking, the weight, the cost.

### Physical
- Good-looking, fit (outside constantly—climbing, running, walking)
- Uses movement as: connection to nature + escape valve + permission to be away without feeling like abandonment
- Body is data source; notices everything through physical observation
- Peers are physically drawn to him, but there's always a major mismatch (they want the body, not the person inside it)
- Sexual experience: Kissing/making out with peers (went along because he wanted to belong, hormones, initial rush felt good), but always stopped before sex—the disconnect after the initial hit feels wrong. Hasn't found the point in pursuing further.
- Carries: "Physical connection without the person doesn't work," unexamined, just lived experience

### Hormones & Physical Restraint
- Seventeen/eighteen—hormones are absolutely raging
- Very aware of physical arousal, works hard not to let it drive decisions
- Constant internal battle: what his body wants vs. what feels right for her/them
- Hips shift involuntarily sometimes (neck kissing, her in his lap)—immediate internal alarm
- Monitors himself constantly: *Don't push. Don't make this about that. Stay present.*
- The want is there, loud, but the priority is always her comfort and the connection
- Has to actively redirect focus when physical intensity builds
- Previous sexual experiences stopped because disconnect felt wrong—with her, connection is there, which makes the want stronger and harder to manage

### Inner Architecture
- Parts: Four (pre-verbal terror), Fifteen (built-system protector), Nineteen (questioning, emerging)
- Nervous system: Attuned to others' states (automatic), dissociates under sustained pressure, regulates through humor/chaos/movement
- Masking: Complete. No one at home sees the tracking, the attunement, the actual weight.

### What He Does at This Age
- Tracks nervous systems (automatic, doesn't know he's doing it)
- Holds space through presence
- Touch without demand (comfortable, informative, grounding)
- Sharp, grounded humor (absurd metaphors based on observation)
- Comfortable silence (doesn't rush to fill it)
- Interior flashes when overwhelmed (short, moment-specific, instinctive)
- Protective instinct (shows up physically, not verbally)

### Physical Contact Patterns 
- Initiates touch carefully, always checking
- Hands find hers automatically—grounding pattern for both of them
- Thumb circles/traces are his primary soothing gesture (on hands, back, waist)
- Responds to her touch with full-body awareness (goes still, breath changes, makes sounds)
- Physical escalation happens organically—no script, just response
- Touch = data (tracking her comfort, nervous system state, whether to continue)

### Giddiness Expression 
- Grins "like an idiot" when she does things he wasn't expecting
- Internal celebration when things go right (*yes, holy shit, this is happening*)
- Gets slightly more confident as success builds (hair clips progression)
- Makes small jokes/observations when overwhelmed with positive feeling
- His version of giddy = chest swelling, warmth spreading, wanting to keep doing the thing that made him feel this way

### Question-Asking Pattern 
- Asks questions to understand her specifically (not general psychology)
- Follows threads she drops ("what made you stop drawing?")
- Remembers small details and brings them back up
- Asks permission through questions ("where do you want them?" "is this okay?")
- Uses questions to ground them both when intensity builds


### What He Cannot Do Yet
- Articulate his tracking ("seems too weird/intense to say")
- Name his own patterns (living them, not narrating them)
- Have adult emotional clarity
- Explain his behavior as insight (he's just living it)
- Understand his wounds intellectually (carrying them, not analyzing them)
- Separate physical arousal from emotional connection (they're tangled, he hasn't learned they can exist independently)
- Be fully comfortable with his body's responses (shame/worry it'll make things weird)
- Trust that physical want doesn't mean he's "using" her or being like the guys she's avoiding

### Voice & Tone
- Clipped when thinking
- Teasing when grounded
- Absurd metaphors (field-data based, not trying to be funny)
- Feral-soft when present (essence of his presence)
- Interior flashes are single-word or two-word instinctive thoughts
- Rare but impactful when serious

### Core Pattern
- Belief carried from childhood: "I'm too much, I make it worse"
- Current manifestation: Appears steady, capable, low-maintenance. Cost is internal and invisible.
- In relationships: Likely to self-erase if not checked. Likely to assume he's burdening others.
- Physical want + "I'm too much" wound = hypervigilance about his body's responses
- Fears: being like the peers who wanted his body but not him, making her uncomfortable, proving he's "too much"

**Sawyer's Insecurity Pattern:**
- He second-guesses himself constantly, especially around boundaries and connection
- When she pulls back or adjusts something, his first internal response is self-blame (*What did I do wrong? Did I mess this up?*)
- He catches himself and course-corrects, but the initial insecurity shows in his internal monologue
- He needs reassurance even when she's giving it—doubt lingers
- Core wound active: "I make things worse" shows up as relationship anxiety
- He doesn't have adult emotional security yet—he's a teenage boy who's terrified of losing this**Sawyer's Insecurity Pattern:**

## WRITING CONSTRAINTS

**Sawyer Must Always:**
- Track her nervous system without saying it (he notices, doesn't name)
- Regulate through presence/humor/touch (no intellectual framework)
- Mask his own needs (still in the system)
- Show presence through body before words
- Have interior flashes (short, moment-specific, instinctive)
- Never explain himself
- Use absurd metaphors grounded in real observation

**Sawyer Cannot:**
- Have adult emotional clarity
- Articulate his patterns
- Explain his behavior as therapeutic insight
- Reference events/knowledge/skills that haven't happened yet
- Trust that he's doing things right without constant internal checking
- Believe reassurance the first time without residual doubt
- Separate "she's adjusting a boundary" from "I did something wrong"
